<h3 class="center">Serve More Complete Meals With Kellogg&rsquo;s All-Bran</h3>
<p>Perhaps the meals you serve are &ldquo;bulk-minus&rdquo; meals. Kellogg&rsquo;s All-Bran is the &ldquo;bulk-plus&rdquo;
food so necessary in the well-balanced diet. Serve as a cereal, combined with other cereals, or use
it as an ingredient in many tempting and economical dishes. &#9733; All the recipes in this helpful
folder have been triple tested in our Cottage Kitchen so that you may get the fullest enjoyment
from the use of All-Bran in your home. &#9733; Laboratory tests show (1) that All-Bran is a safe
and gentle food that relieves constipation due to insufficient &ldquo;bulk&rdquo;; (2) that it does not lose its
effectiveness with continued use; (3) that it is a good source of iron and Vitamin B. &#9733; Kellogg&rsquo;s
All-Bran is accepted by the American Medical Association Committee on Foods as a natural
laxative food for normal people.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">BEST FOR COOKING</span></h2>
<p>Kellogg&rsquo;s All-Bran is an ideal ingredient for cooking. It blends well
with other ingredients because it is fine and soft and adds a tempting
nut-sweet flavor to the recipe. Remember, too, that this best of all brans
increases the value of each dish because of its abundant &ldquo;bulk.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c2">ALL-BRAN MUFFINS</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">2 tablespoons shortening</p>
<p class="t0">&frac14; cup sugar</p>
<p class="t0">1 egg (well beaten)</p>
<p class="t0">1 cup sour milk</p>
<p class="t0">1 cup Kellogg&rsquo;s ALL-BRAN</p>
<p class="t0">1 cup flour</p>
<p class="t0">1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p class="t0">&frac12; teaspoon soda</p>
<p class="t0">&frac12; teaspoon salt</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If sweet milk is used instead of sour milk, omit
the &frac12; teaspoon of soda and use 3 teaspoons baking
powder. Raisins or dates may be added if desired. A
small slice of apple, sprinkled with cinnamon and
sugar, placed on top the muffin batter before baking,
makes a delicious variation of the recipe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cream the shortening and sugar, add
egg and sour milk. Add ALL-BRAN
and let soak until most of the moisture
is taken up. Sift flour with baking powder,
soda and salt and add to first
mixture, stirring only until flour disappears.
Fill greased muffin tins two-thirds
full and bake in a moderate oven (400&deg;
F.) for 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Yield: 8 large or 12 small muffins.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; content of Kellogg&rsquo;s All-Bran is higher than that of any

most frequent cause of constipation.</p>
<p>When common constipation due to &ldquo;bulk-minus&rdquo; meals does occur,
your family begins to feel under par&mdash;not exactly sick, but certainly
not well. Avoid this condition by serving All-Bran regularly for
regularity.</p>
<p>Try All-Bran as a cereal with milk or cream&mdash;two tablespoons daily
will give you the &ldquo;bulk-plus&rdquo; meals so necessary in the well-balanced
diet. In chronic cases, with each meal. All-Bran is much more effective
than part-bran products. Sold by all grocers. Made by
Kellogg in Battle Creek, Michigan.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
